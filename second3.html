One component investors must realize is the role that the media has over public perception. Historically, a few bad newspaper headlines could tank a stock&rsquo;s value. However, nowadays, the rate and speed at which information is being disseminated, investors must also keep up. Through the journey of sustainable investing, the core concept is applying the existing tactics and strategies that are being used but with the alternative form of data being ESG focused.This is the current foundation for the current project, however this paper will further discuss an added dimension of possibility</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Financial news analysis has been a long researched subject and it is well known that the market shifts real-time in accordance to the news. With the rise of big data, the challenge is the method to analyze so much information at once. Enter neural networks. Using this predictive power, the research paper created a novel method of analyzing the volatility based on ESG news. It creates a direct end-to-end process, or pipeline, from news extraction to transformer based language models. Specifically, applying these concepts to a working project would imply all these contributions into a real-world application.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c2">Drawing from a similar library of research, there exists many existing pretrained models</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">that extract the ESG vocabulary. One such example is BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, developed by Google in 2018. It&rsquo;s a pretrained from a corpus of over 3000M words. Applying this baseline model to target and classify ESG related news is the goal of this paper. One barrier of entry in terms of use-case is the amount of statistical analysis behind this research. To be honest, most of the math is beyond a graduate level of understanding. For example, one would require to understand how the research paper uses the &ldquo;modern stochastic gradient based Markov Chain Monte Carlo&rdquo;. Even the definition of this seems incomprehensible - &ldquo;&quot;comprise a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The more steps that are included, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.&quot; . However, for our use cases, only a basic understanding of the theory is required as computer programming can handle the computation for us. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c2">&nbsp;The core concept is numerically assigning vectors to text to graph its interpreted meaning. In this way, the model is trained and then applied to another time period to test the results. Backtesting must make sure that the model is not overtrained as well. Originally, a pure sentiment analysis seemed to be the most lucrative option but this paper shows that its model is more effective. The application to the project seems clear, this is another layer of complexity to add for investors to consider. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
