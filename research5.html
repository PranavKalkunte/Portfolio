On the stairs leading up to the library, I found the chance to reconnect with an old friend from middle school. With his profound insight from being an ISM II student, surprisingly in the same field of FinTech that I&rsquo;m hoping to delve into, I got some quick tips on how to develop a model on Matplotlib. The general networking was an interesting experience yet ironically the hardest part was not striking up a conversation with someone but finding a way to leave it gracefully. For example, I heard a professional mention athletics on the offhand while passing by him and immediately used it as a way to hook onto his hockey and off-season cross country experience while being able to connect that to his role as a manager in a logistics and transportation company. On the other hand, it was difficult to exit a conversation with a medical professional, to no offense I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken much interest in, without seeming disrespectful. Perhaps this in of itself was a skill to be learned while networking. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick rundown of my insights of the rotating sessions as follows. I found the &lsquo;21st Century Professionalism&rsquo; to be an engaging lecture by a professor but the connection is somewhat repetitive of what we have learnt in the classroom. Nonetheless, the delivery provided a ready paradigm shift to reorient ourselves into the business world. &lsquo;SEL&rsquo; was seen by many as a session of negligible impact but resonated most strongly with the day-to-day issues I face personally. It was the only session I mustered up the courage to ask a question out loud in and would have loved to have a chance to speak longer with the professional. &lsquo;Break&rsquo; and &lsquo;Networking Team Building&rsquo; meshed together into a continuous half an hour. I enjoyed the chance to let loose from the continuous professionalism and casually make new friends. Towards the end, I found myself looking at some empty interview booths and took upon the opportunity to strike up a question with one of the professionals. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">To my good fortune, I found myself sitting across from a Specialist Executive at Deloitte Consulting. &nbsp;He elaborated on one of the few key pieces of wisdom that were my takeaways from the event. I explained to him my interest in working with clients and having that people interaction perhaps through sales. He countered with the idea that this role exists in every major field - health, business, technology - and that honing on which area of specialization to apply my intended career goal would lead to the greatest success. He proceeded to provide insight on the career trajectory of finance professionals, solidifying my interest in pursuing the same. During the actual &lsquo;Mock Interview&rsquo; session, I was able to capture the opportunity to have another interview - this time with a program manager in civil engineering. A rough contrast to what I was interested in, nonetheless I set out myself to make the most of the time I had with him - inquiring about his role as a program manager. From questions ranging from the environmental impacts of the projects he manages to a recent Tamil movie that had come out, it was a fresh set of pace to speak with someone outside of the finance world. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Professional Panel&rsquo; and &lsquo;ISM Alumni&rsquo; blended together into a series of quick exchanges and questions. And finally the guest neatly tied up the theme and message of the business symposium as a whole. A beaming moment on the staircase, I flashed a smile at the camera as we took a program photo of all the ISM students at Independence High School. The greatest reflection comes not from the individual interactions but the overall experience of the symposium. It truly set the core vision of being in Independent Study and Mentorship and the opportunity to excel it provided me. The connections with the community and the professionals helped stretch my wings to apply my knowledge to greater heights. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
