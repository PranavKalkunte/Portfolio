In summary, the intuition behind the concept is quite simple yet the methodology becomes the most perplexing part. Investor views here can be thought of as ESG metrics that are sources as an alternative source of data rather than expected returns. Markowitz paradigm reaffirmed that diversification of assets can lead to a lower risk, integrating ESG may also reduce this further. Unlike mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman allows us to input confidence levels of given views which reduces the input sensitivity for the portfolio. ESG views can be seen as relative views in comparison to other stocks. Meucci (2002) and Meucci (2008) present a model for non-traditional views instead of returns that may need to be substituted for here. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>Let us examine the inputs for the model and how we would acquire them for the application of it into a project. Returns are simply the annual change in price and risk can be viewed as the year volatility or standard deviation. So far the data I have collected only involve high-cap stocks as smaller ones seem to lack the analytics regarding ESG. Combined with the market capitalization weights (wmkt),and a risk aversion, that can be determined (E(r)&ndash;rf )/&sigma;^2) or manually inputted, we can generate a covariance matrix (&Sigma;) and an implied equilibrium return vector. (&Pi; = </span><span>&lambda;&Sigma;wmkt</span><span class="c0">). The views (Q) are of course the aforementioned ESG metrics. These appear on a relative scale to each other and thus are not absolute views. The uncertainty (&Omega;) can be derived. Combining the prior equilibrium distribution and the view distribution gives us the combined return distribution. ([(&tau;&Sigma;)^&ndash;1+ (P &prime;&Omega;^&ndash;1P )]^&ndash;1 ) ) . Notably here is that the original formulation of the model isn&#39;t provided in the original Black Litterman paper, only an example is used. It&#39;s not until later that the derivation is provided. He and Litterman (2002) write about how this model is more intuitive than it seems. It&#39;s rather the mathematical formulation behind it that causes confusion regarding the parameters. One thing to point out here is that extensive matrix knowledge is not required to work with this model as even the simplest interface such as MS Excel can do most of the matrix manipulation for us. Research has proven that this model provides a lower risk compared to traditional asset allocation models. Combined with the fact that ESG on its own also reduces long-term risk of an asset, synthesizing these two concepts should reduce risk even further and possibly increase expected returns. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">The Black-Litterman model, since introduced, has become a staple in any portfolio. The best avenue for further research may be to understand what role non-traditional data such as ESG would impact how it functions. Changing certain aspects such as the implied confidence and view uncertainty may spell out different outcomes due to the nature of the investor view. Mapping out what historical returns of active and passive portfolios under this premise may lead to stronger conclusions regarding the value of ESG as opposed to trading strategies such as tilt and momentum. </span></p><p class="c3 c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
