              <h2>Business Symposium Focused</h2>
              <p>
                The Business Symposium was one of my first experiences in a professional environment. I found that the most interactive part - the networking - applied not only with professionals but also other students as well. The connections and insight I was able to gain, even in fields other than my own, allowed to be broaden my view my own future career outlook. For example, even on the stairs up to the library, I was able to get advice on my prospective ISM project from another student. The symposium allowed me to glean into what it meant to really be a professional - a core theme of the keynote speaker's address. The qualities and aptitudes interviewers are looking for have changed with the modern business world and we, students, have the chance to make the most of the opportunities presented to us even in high school. Often times I slip into a casual tone with the people I interact with. In the middle of an interview I was able to connect with the professional on a recent movie released in his local language. While forming connections seamlessly in one of my strengths, I have to be aware of the setting to maintain professionalism. Overall, the symposium was a seamless experience, including the lunch we got together afterwards. What really struck out with me the most was the level of high regard that even the working adults held towards and my hope to be able to live up to that expectation of high achievement in the future.              </p>
