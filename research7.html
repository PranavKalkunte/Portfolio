Even as I asked him questions, the friendly atmosphere never left the office - a mark of an experience of working with clients. What struck me the strongest was the level of regard that Mr. Bruns gave to me even though I was a student. He treated me more like a prospective client and future member of the community if anything else.The soft skills made it clear how easy it was for him to engage with clients on a personal level. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Mr. Bruns had followed the footsteps of his father, Mr. Bruns. Describing his entry into breaking the financial world, he inauspiciously began in the year of 2008. Earning just four figures in the beginning, over the course of nearing 15 years, he&rsquo;s been able to grow that to six figures. Wealth management is something that grows over time as one gains more clients as well as AUM (assets under management). As a commission-based model, the better one does the more they can earn. My concerns of how easily one could pivot in and out of the wealth management role were also alleviated. To Mr. Bruns, being a part of the community is what led him to his success. A longtime resident of north Dallas along with his father, he&rsquo;s been able to be a pillar of the growing area. My second set of questions began in regards to his relation with Merrill and Bank of America. The role he has is more of</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">an independent business with the foundation and support of Merrill. He maintains his own firm in a sense but is able to tap into the resources of the wider network. Learning about research analyst roles and receiving some of their contacts may be useful for my original work and final project. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What was originally planned to be fifteen minutes turned out to become almost an hour. Time flew as we conversed on the many aspects of the field. Mr. Bruns was gracious enough to provide me with his time. Towards the end, he gave me the book &ldquo;Investing for a Lifetime &#39;&#39; by Richard C Marston. I was really touched as he had no reason to do it yet he wanted to inspire my interest in the field further. Additionally, he provided me with two stacks of papers. The first is an investment sample outlining the structure as one would present to a client. The second is a sample wealth analysis, again of an example of how it would be prepared for a fictional client. My most insightful takeaway was the level of soft skills a professional must possess. No matter how much research analysis an advisor can bring to the table, if they&rsquo;re not able to build that empathetic and personal connection with the person sitting across from them, it&rsquo;s of no avail. There is a great deal of trust when dealing with life savings of a client and Mr. Bruns became someone that after less than an hour, even I would place my faith in.</span></p></body></html>
