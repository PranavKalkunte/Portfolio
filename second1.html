The purpose of the interview was to gain insights into his experience as a researcher for the NJIT Venture Fund and as a member of the NJIT Investment Fund, as well as his experience as a co-founder of a FinTech ESG startup.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I began the interview by asking Mr. Smith about his experience working with the NJIT Venture Fund. He shared that as a fellowship researcher, he received a graduate scholarship to identify early-stage startups of potential investment for the fund. He explained that he conducted startup research according to specific criteria while maintaining a database of potential funding options. Mr. Smith&#39;s ability to identify and evaluate potential investment opportunities was evident and I was impressed by the level of detail and thought that he put into his work.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Next, I asked Mr. Smith about his experience as a member of the NJIT Investment Fund. He shared that he conducted equity research and analysis to construct, optimize, and manage a sponsored equity portfolio. He also discussed how he used financial data and analytics to evaluate firms from a long-term perspective, and how he used industry standard asset allocation and portfolio optimization techniques to make decisions on rebalancing the capital allocation. I found this information particularly valuable as it gave me a deeper understanding of the process of equity research and portfolio management, and I appreciated the practical insights that Mr. Smith provided.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I also asked Mr. Smith about his experience as a co-founder of a FinTech ESG startup. He shared that he collaborated with an experienced FinTech professor and other members to develop an autonomous wealth management platform emphasizing customization and socially responsible standards. He also discussed how he researched and generated different asset allocation and portfolio optimization algorithms to integrate ESG criteria, ETFs, equity securities, investor preferences, and risk/return management through Python. I found this information to be unexpected as I was not aware of the significance of socially responsible investing in the FinTech industry. However, I appreciated learning about the different tools and techniques that Mr. Smith used to integrate ESG criteria into his investment strategies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In conclusion, the interview with Mr. Smith was incredibly informative and exciting. I learned a lot about the different aspects of the finance industry and the different roles that professionals can play within it. I also appreciated the practical insights and examples that Mr. Smith provided, which helped me to better understand the concepts and techniques that he discussed. The information that I received during the interview will be incredibly valuable as I continue to explore the field of finance and I am grateful to Mr. Smith for taking the time to speak with me.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
