Quantitative finance utilizes mathematical models in investment management. The rise of data has led to the increased use of computational models in portfolios. By performing systematic reviews of data sets and implementing them into financial frameworks, &lsquo;quants&rsquo; are able to obtain a higher alpha - expected return - than traditional fundamental investment managers. As a growing field, being able to replicate the process of analysts would be of great personal gain. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Asset allocation is the methodology to construct a portfolio of a basket of securities that can lead to long-term returns. ESG are value metrics that define how well a certain corporation may be sustainable. It takes into account the three pillars of the acronym - environmental, social and governance. It should be the fiduciary responsibility of an investor to encourage corporate sustainable responsibility by value investing into securities that uphold certain ethics. Meta-analysis proves that ESG actually can lead to reduced risk and increased profits in the long run. By integrating this into the construction of a portfolio, it allows investors to fulfill multiple objectives - profit and personal value. From my research, I have found a suitable framework - the Black-Litterman model - that can be expounded upon to incorporate ESG metrics. A key feature of this model is that it builds on Modern Portfolio Theory using mean-variance optimization but allows integrating investor views to take into account. This model would need to be fine-tuned to take into the nuance of ESG data values and its variability. As a student, the process would be threefold: identifying the nature of ESG metrics and categories; identifying the quantitative model and working upon its framework; and finally to create a finished model that could be accessible to the everyday investor. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span>Contrary to popular belief, the financial world is much more grounded in empirical and quantitative analysis before setting out on any investment decision. Taking into account my strong skill set in mathematics as well as data science, I would be able to navigate these models. As a continual public advocate of social responsibility and the dangerous effects of unchecked profit exploitation, ESG investing is in alignment with my own personal values. Once again, I would like to stress the importance of the investor to be responsible in their investment decisions, yet one barrier is the lack of ease in incorporating their values. Being able to engage with investors in creating a final product that would allow them to fulfill both their monetary and ethical goals would give me self-fulfillment as well. Thus, I would like to propose my further research into my topic proposal of ESG asset allocation to forward my exploration of quantitative finance in this niche field allowing me to gain insight at a greater depth. </span></p></body></html>
