              <h2>Focused on the Research Process and Discovery</h2>
              <p>
                My own research process has been insightful to say the least. I was able to divide my annotated bibliographies in three key areas. First, I researched what ESG investing looks like, analyzing literature reviews to empirical evidence. Second, I looked at a specific portfolio construction model that incorporated investor views into its framework - the Black-Litterman model. And finally, third, I reviewed research that synthesized both ESG investing that the aforementioned model to maximize alpha - expected return. The greatest satisfaction will be the task of constructing this model by myself for the prospective project and incorporating my gained knowledge of possible implementations. The above detailed researched enlightened me of the nature of the quantitative field in finance. On the back-end, comprehensive research is done of strategies before being implemented. New and novel avenues of outperforming the market are continuously updating with even the Black-Litterman model only being introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The finance industry is rapidly expanding the integrate the data-driven possibilities of computational models. Seeing the roadmaps of possible extended research at the end of every conclusion of academic articles has piqued my interest to explore these routes. The financial field, contrary to popular belief, is a world much more grounded in analytical research and empirical evidence before taking any action. Mathematical models are driving the analysis increasing the opportunity of 'quants' for every investment corporation. Researching even a niche implementation in finance has overwhelmed with the depth of the industry. I hope that my continual process of research discovery is able to reach the level of quality that marks this field.              </p>
