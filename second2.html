Investor tools can be divided into four main categories - trading, education, tracking and analysis. This final product proposal will break down each category and create a scope of development in each category to provide a comprehensive product that can be utilized by the everyday investor.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">METHODOLOGY</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading: Unfortunately, trading is dominated by existing financial institutions. It is not in the scope of the project to, for example, create a new brokerage or even new index fund. However, the product can interact with existing trading tools. For example, the product will aim to communicate with brokerages to allow for trading. Many brokerage platforms have APIs (Application Programming Interface) that allows for our product to communicate with the software of the brokerage. While the product cannot directly sell securities, it can provide tools on suggestions to invest. If a brokerage does not have an API, even just providing this type of information to later be implemented by the investor on their own terms suffices. Since the goal is creating an impact to the community, the product must allow for a direct pipeline to actionable steps an investor can take.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education: Contrasted to the original work, the final product will create a dashboard that investors can use to educate themselves on ESG. The problem is that the average person does not have sufficient research on the subject to make informed decisions. Utilizing the existing research already done on the subject, the aim is to present and display it in an accessible form. This was a key component of the work that was missing in the original work - which albeit had some user preference input - was missing a good user interface. Thus the only people who could effectively use the original work were already informed investors who would have done prior research on the subject. To change this deficit, creating an engaging user experience is a primary goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking: This is a natural extension of trading and requires the product to interact with existing brokerage software. The big idea for the original work was &ldquo;asset allocation and portfolio integration&rdquo;. However, the original work only had allocation of assets but did not have any integration. To improve this, tracking existing portfolios that an investor may have and providing personalized output of changes that can be made is the key goal. Investment advice that can be made to be directly applied to already existing securities will make the product an informed decision that anyone will be able to consider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis: This category is the one with the most avenue of scope. Multiple ideas can be applied here. The first is analyzing and presenting information on different stocks, riffing off the education aspect of this product. Second is a key feature that, if implemented, will be the main focus of the product - sentiment analysis. With our modern constant flow of information, it is difficult for the investor to stay up to date with all the different news that is happening around the world. The idea is to create a sentiment analysis model that can analyze news headlines looking for ESG related keywords and determine what the volatility of a company&rsquo;s stock would be based on the verbiage of the news. This, if implemented correctly, would be a significant application of existing literature on the subject of ESG. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the final product aims to be a successful and accessible version of the original work, Greensight. To create a suite of investor tools that can direct investors towards actionable advice and simultaneously raise awareness of ESG issues is the statement of purpose for the final product. Building on the initial foundation, the end goal is to create an interactive web app that has a user interface as well as the complex models to be usable in the financial world. </span></p></body></html>
